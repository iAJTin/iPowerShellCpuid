and then with the result obtained, the 'Get-CpuidProperty' call tries to obtain the property information, remember that a property it is made up of your key and its value.

PS> Get-CpuidProperty -Property (Get-CpuidLocateProperty -Name Manufacturer) | CPUID-Property -Property (CPUID-Locate-Property -Name Manufacturer)
